# Infosys+ Android Workshop 2022: Databases

On 25 March 2022 the ISTD Senior Student Board conducted a workshop on how to setup and integrate a stack for using an external database with an Android app, consisting of a SQL database, a REST API web server and the app. Covered technologies included MySQL, FastAPI and Android Java programming.

### Repository structure

- /StudentRegistry contains the completed Android app used for this workshop
